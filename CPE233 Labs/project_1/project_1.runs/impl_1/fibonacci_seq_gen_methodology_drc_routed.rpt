LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ff/FSM_sequential_PS[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) MY_REG/data_out_reg[0]/CLR, MY_REG/data_out_reg[1]/CLR, MY_REG/data_out_reg[2]/CLR, MY_REG/data_out_reg[3]/CLR, MY_REG/data_out_reg[4]/CLR, MY_REG/data_out_reg[5]/CLR, MY_REG/data_out_reg[6]/CLR, MY_REG/data_out_reg[7]/CLR, MY_REG/data_out_reg[8]/CLR, MY_REG/data_out_reg[9]/CLR, MY_REG2/data_out_reg[0]/CLR, MY_REG2/data_out_reg[1]/CLR, MY_REG2/data_out_reg[2]/CLR, MY_REG2/data_out_reg[3]/CLR, MY_REG2/data_out_reg[4]/CLR (the first 15 of 24 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
